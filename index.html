        <section><h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>Hello there! my name is Dur-e-Shahwar.
            I'm a self-taught artist and an undergraduate computer-science student.
             The sole purpose of creating this website is to help people who are interested in arts but don't have access to formal art education or are interested
              in persuing a stem degree but want to learn how to draw just for fun or to expand their skillset.
            </p>
            <p>
                So,this is basically a mix of my interest in graphite drawing and computer-science. 
              Keep in mind I don't claim to be an expert in arts, I'm still learning myself but I will try my best to share the knowledge I've gained through my own practice and research for people who don't know where to begin.
            </p>
