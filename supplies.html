        You don't need to buy any type of art supplies to learn you just need a pencil(of any type) and paper. 
        however, if you want to improve further then ofcourse using better supplies can help but remember they won't magically make you better only continues practice will.

        Here are some supplies that can help:

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Supply</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Pencils</td>
            <td>Pencils are available in various grades starting from 2H to 9B. 2H (h is for hard) being the hardest and lighest while 9B (b is for black) being the softest and darkest.It's better to use a hard pencil for sketching the foundation as its easier to erase them I personally recommend using an HB pencil for that purpose.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Kneaded Eraser</td>
            <td>One can work with a simple eraser but kneaded erasers are more versatile. They can be transformed into desired shapes and are useful for creating smooth transitions from highlights to shadows.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sharpener/exacto knife</td>
            <td>To keep pencils sharp for fine details.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Blending Stumps/paint brushes/cotton swabs</td>
            <td>
                Used to blend graphite for smooth shading you can use any of these or all three depending on your preference (you can even use your fingers).
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Paper</td>
            <td>
                Any type of paper will do but if you want a better drawing experience use smooth, heavyweight paper (like bristol paper) as it can handle more layers of graphite and blending without tearing.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>graphite powder</td>
            <td>Used for creating smooth, even tones while covering large areas, can be applied using brushes.</td>
        </tr>
